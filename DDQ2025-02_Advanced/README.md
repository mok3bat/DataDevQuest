# 📘 README — DDQ2025-02: Update Connection Details for a Workbook Data Source (Beginner)
This project solves the DataDev Quest 2025 Challenge #2 (Beginner), which involves using the Tableau REST API to update the connection information of a workbook's embedded data source.

🔍 Challenge Overview
In this challenge, you're tasked with:


- Accessing its published data source with embedded connection

- Updating the connection credentials or host/port/database details


This is particularly useful when migrating workbooks between environments (e.g., dev to prod) or updating authentication methods without having to manually download and re-upload the workbook.
